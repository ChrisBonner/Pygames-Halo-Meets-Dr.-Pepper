# Pygames-Halo-Meets-Dr.-Pepper
Final Python 2D Game for Game Development level 1

For Game Development Level 1 class, we were required to create a game using Python - PyGames. I chose to create a 2D side-scroller based on Halo. The game has an opening splash screen, the main menu along with settings and score. Once the player selects the level of difficulty, they are taken into the game. 

The player plays as Master Chief, using A, D, Space and Left mouse button for the controls. The player moves forward and encounters random/auto-generating enemies that jump and fire towards the player. The goal is for the player to shoot them. If the player ignores them, they will turn and shoot after the player. Finally, the player comes to the boss fight, a giant Dr. Pepper can. The boss hovers in the air moving back and forth across the screen. At random the boss will shake and drop to the ground. If the boss hits the player, the shield or life goes down. If the player is standing on the ground when the boss hits the ground, the player is stunned for a duration and takes a little damage. The player needs to jump in the air when the boss goes to hit the ground and shoot it. After the boss has lost enough life, he dies. The player is taking to a score screen to enter his name and compare how well he did to others.

This program was made by Chris Bonner.

This program was coded in python using pygames.
The user will need to install a couple of programs to get to run.

python 2.7.3 windows installer located at http://www.python.org/download/

pygames-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi installer located at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

wxPython located at http://wxpython.org/download.php

Once the programs are installed right click on main.py and select open with IDLE

The controls are as follows:

A = left
D = right
space = jump
left mouse button = fire
