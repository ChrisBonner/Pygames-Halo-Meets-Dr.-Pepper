# Pygames-Halo-Meets-Dr.-Pepper
Final Python 2D Game for Game Development level 1


This program was made by Chris Bonner.

This program was coded in python using pygames.
The user will need to install a couple of programs to get to run.

python 2.7.3 windows installer located at http://www.python.org/download/

pygames-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi installer located at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

wxPython located at http://wxpython.org/download.php

Once the programs are installed right click on main.py and select open with IDLE

Select run at the top and select run module or just press F5

Enter your name and hit enter

The main menu has start, difficulty, and exit

On the difficulty screen you can select easy, medium, hard, or extreme.

The controls are as follows:

A = left
D = right
space = jump
left mouse button = fire

The difficulty determines how fast your shield regenerates.

There is only one level and a boss.

The boss is a Dr. Pepper can. It goes back and forth randomly shaking then dropping to the ground.

If the player is on the ground when the can comes down, the player will take damage and be stunned. 

If the can hits the player, the player will take damage.
